# Secret Identity - Client
Secret Identity is a full stack, browser-based game where the player attempts to guess the secret identity of an AI opponent by asking yes-or-no questions. Player's guesses are sent to a server which is connected to the OpenAI API for real-time content generation. The web app uses React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
